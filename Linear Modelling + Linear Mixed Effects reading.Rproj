```{r}



pitch = c(233,204,242,130,112,142)
sex = c(rep("female", 3), rep("male",3))

#Making a dataframe of the the rows created above

mydf = data.frame(sex,pitch)

xmdl = lm(pitch ~sex, mydf)
summary(xmdl)

#We constructed a linear model of pitch as a function on sex. This model was significant (F(1,4)=46,61, p<0.01)

#The p-value of overall model has the same value as the sexmale, since this is the onl fixed effect. Were there more, the significance would have been different.

mean = (mydf[mydf$sex=="female",]$pitch)
# Above code = the mean of female voice pitch valies = very similar to the estimate value in the intercept column.

age = c(14, 23, 35, 48,52,67)
pitch = c(252,244,240, 233, 212, 204)
mydf = data.frame(age, pitch)
xmdl = lm(pitch ~ age, mydf)
summary (xmdl)

#Estimage for age = -0.9099 --> only means that for every 1 age you go up, the pitch of your voice will lower by 0.9099 Hz.


#Subtracting the mean age from each value --> create a new column that is the age variable w/ the mean subtracted from it.This will be theresulting coefficient table.

mydf$age.c = mydf$age - mean(mydf$age)
xmdl = lm(pitch ~ age.c, mydf)
summary(xmdl)

#Plot a resudial plot
plot(fitted(xmdl),residuals(xmdl))


#It is a good idea to generate some random data to see how a plot with roughly ewual variances looks like --> 2 sets of 100 normally distributed random numbers w/ mean = 0 and sd = 1.

plot(rnorm(100),rnorm(100))


#Test for normality of residuals

#histogram
hist(residuals(xmdl))

#qqplot
qqnorm(residuals(xmdl))

#Check if any infueltial datapoints are missing --> gives us DF beta values --> values with which the coefficients have to be adjusted if a particular data point is excluded.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
